This project is to solve the "Burger Buddies Problem".
Just "ndk-build" in jni folder and then run in Android shell with four parameters(./BBC #Cooks #Cashiers #Customers #RackSize).
After all customers satified, the process will end safely.

In the initial program, 
the max time of making a burger by a cook is 4(line 6),
the max time of a cashier sleeping is 3(line 7),
the max time of a customer arriving after program running is 10(line 8),
the max time of a customer making an order is 2(line 9),
the max number of Cooks/Cashiers/Customers is 100(line 10),
if it is needed, please change the maximum value.

The "testscript" file contains one run of my program.
./BBC 2 4 41 10
